<h2>My Machine Learning Projects from my first year at The University of Texas at Austin as a human-centered data science major. </h2>

<body>

Welcome to my coding repository of an array of projects I coded myself and worked on in my Introductory machine learning and data science class. 
The purpose of this repository is to showcase these projects. Please feel free to click around each of the ipynb's, writing assignments, or anything else. 

Some of these projects include:
- web scraping with REST API
- dataframe methods
- SQL projects
